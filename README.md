# Disease-Diagnosis-app
Disease Diagnosis System: Machine Learning | Python | Flask | HTML
Built an intelligent disease diagnosis system that predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms using a trained ML model.
Developed an end-to-end web application using Flask and HTML for real-time symptom input and diagnosis delivery. Achieved 94.2% prediction accuracy with the help of a custom-trained model using decision tree classifiers.
Designed for scalability and ease of access, the solution has been effectively used in academic and clinical demo environments to streamline preliminary health assessments.
